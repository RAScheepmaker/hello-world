# hello-world

Testing and practising with github.

## Command line tools

You need to be superuser to run these commands, therefore I already added "sudo" to the examples. 

### Clone

To grab a complete repository and make a local copy:

> git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

This creates a new local directory for the files and copies all the files in the repository.

### Fetch

If you already have a local copy, you can use Fetch to grab all the new remote files:

> sudo git fetch remotename

### Merge

Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others.

> sudo git merge remotename/branchname

### Pull

Shortcut for completing both git fetch and git merge in one command:

> sudo git pull remotename branchname

or just pull everything with:

> sudo git pull

### Renaming files

### Adding files

### Commit

### Push
